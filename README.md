# Car-Price-Predictoion

1. Load the car price dataset
2. Split the dataset into features (X) and target (y)
3. Split the data into training and testing sets

4. Feature Scaling (optional but recommended):
   - Standardize or normalize the numerical features (e.g., mileage, year) to a common scale

5. Model Building:
   a. Initialize the linear regression model
   b. Train the model using the training data

6. Model Evaluation:
   a. Make predictions on the test set
   b. Calculate evaluation metrics (e.g., MSE, RMSE, MAE, R2) to assess model performance

7. Deployment (optional):
   a. Save the trained model to a file for future use
   b. Create a simple web application or API to accept input features and return car price predictions

8. Prediction:
   a. Input car features (e.g., make, model, year, mileage, etc.)
   b. Preprocess the input data (e.g., handle missing values, encode categorical variables)
   c. Scale the numerical features (if applicable)
   d. Use the trained linear regression model to predict the car price
   e. Output the predicted car price

9. End
